# LQG Control for H₂O₂ Injection System

This MATLAB code implements a Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controller to regulate hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) concentration using state estimation (Kalman filter) and optimal control (LQR).

## Features
- State-space identification from experimental CSV data
- LQR design with tunable Q and R
- Kalman filter for state estimation
- Simulated closed-loop performance
- MATLAB plots for control effort and output response
